## General

Inline Success Messages (from now on: ISM) replaces MyBB's default behavior when you update your UserCP settings, returning a success message instead of a (un)friendly redirection page. It's inspired by IPBoard's systems.

ISM works with MyBB 1.8. It uses MyBB’s default message handler which is jGrowl. 1.6 users should manually load jQuery and jGrowl into ISM’s template.

If you have any feature request, suggestion, or you want to report any issue, please let me know opening a new issue on GitHub. Your contribute is very important to me and helps me into making ISM more complete on every commit.

I no longer support the legacy version (1.x), which was specifically built for 1.6 and used awful hacks to edit 40+ templates at one time. To 1.6 users, I suggest either upgrading to 1.8 or to add jQuery and jGrowl.
